# Wow Such

A Dogecoin price calculator, written in [dogescript][1].

### Development

Clone the project:

`$ git clone git@github.com:swirlycheetah/wowsuch.git`

Install the required development modules:

`$ npm install`

Once you made amendments run `grunt build` to test the built project from the build folder.

### Caveats

The project is currently in it's very early stages and is therefore likely to change significantly as features are added and issues raised.

Use [this tool][2] for writing your dogescript. I plan on creating another branch without any dogescript compiling to encourage contributions.

I urge anyone to raise issues and PR's around project architecture and build process as it's somewhat hacked together currently.
